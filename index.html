    <h2>RESEARCH PROJECTS</h2>
    <h3>HIGH-LEVEL PARALLEL LANGUAGES FOR HPC</h3>
    <p>Ongoing</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Developing a new distributed parallel runtime for the Standard ML language targeted at HPC applications</li>
      <li>Created a new version of the NAS benchmark suite using MPL (a parallel compiler for Standard ML) to enable direct comparison between HLPLs and lower-level languages for HPC</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>MPI COLLECTIVE AUTOTUNING USING ML</h3>
    <p>Ongoing</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Developing a machine-learning autotuner that automatically selects the optimal MPI collective algorithm</li>
      <li>Invented multiple optimizations to make ML-based MPI autotuning feasible on large-scale systems</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>CACHE COHERENCE FOR HIGH-LEVEL PARALLEL LANGUAGES</h3>
    <p>2020-2022</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Identified a low-level memory property called WARD that can be introduced by construction in high-level parallel programs</li>
      <li>Implemented a custom cache coherence protocol in the Sniper architectural simulator and found an average speedup of 1.46 across the PBBS benchmark suite</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>DEVELOPING COMPUTATIONAL ARCHITECTURES (DECA)</h3>
    <p>2017-2019</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Developed DeCA: a platform that enables application researchers to prototype FPGA accelerator designs through industry-standard tools and custom software</li>
      <li>Created a custom FPGA accelerator using DeCA for a neuroscience application to showcase the platform’s capabilities; achieved 1.5x speedup</li>
    </ul>
