  title: Welcome!
  summary: |
    My name is Mike Wilkins, and I research optimizations for AI workloads on high-performance computing systems. As a Maria Goeppert Mayer Fellow at Argonne National Laboratory, I'm currently leading the development of a new holistic online autotuner. I previously completed my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering at Northwestern University and have industry experience at Cornelis Networks and Meta. I am open to collaboration opportunities, please feel free to reach out with ideas or questions!

      details:
        - Invented many optimizations to make ML-based MPI autotuning feasible on large-scale systems
        - Developed the world’s first exascale-capable MPI collective algorithm autotuner and achieved up to 20% speedups for production applications
        - Exploring new “holistic” tuning methodologies to encompass performance-critical parameters across the software stack, targeting large scale AI workloads
    - role: Algorithms for Collective Communication
      resume: yes
      time: Ongoing
      details:
        - Created new generalized MPI collective algorithms that expose a tunable radix and outperform the previous best algorithms by up to 4.5x
        - Exploring new generalized algorithms for GPU-specific collective communication (e.g., NCCL) and new abstractions (e.g., circulant graphs)
    - role: High-Level Parallel Languages for HPC
      resume: no
      time: 2019-2023
      details:
        - Developed a new hardware/software co-design for the Standard ML language targeted at HPC systems and applications, including AI
        - Created a new version of the NAS benchmark suite using MPL (a parallel compiler for Standard ML) to enable direct comparison between HLPLs and lower-level languages for HPC
    - role: Cache Coherence for High-Level Parallel Languages
      resume: no
      time: 2019-2022
      details:
        - Identified a low-level memory property called WARD in high-level parallel programs
        - Implemented a custom cache coherence protocol in the Sniper architectural simulator and found an average speedup of 1.46x across the PBBS benchmark suite.
